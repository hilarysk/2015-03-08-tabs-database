##SUMMARY: 
A stylized, tabular one-page application that would allow a user to view, add, delete and edit items from a database. It's a responsive site using JavaScript, CSS (including some implementation of object-oriented CSS) and HTML. The Ruby involved is minimal, as the site was mostly a front-end exercise.
